    "text": "I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University, working at the intersection of political economy, political institutions, and political behavior. Previously, I was a Fox International Fellow at Yale University (2021–2022). I received my PhD from the Department of Political Science at Freie Universität Berlin in 2023.\nMy work is organized around a core question: how institutional arrangements and market risks jointly shape policy outcomes and political behavior. I pursue two main lines of research. The first examines how political institutions shape policy outputs, with a focus on housing, homelessness governance, and the production of spatial inequality. The second studies how exposure to market risks, particularly in housing and energy markets, affects political attitudes and democratic satisfaction. Methodologically, I use causal inference with observational data, complemented by survey experiments and qualitative data that I transform into structured data for analysis. My work has been published in Perspectives on Politics and Urban Affairs Review."
