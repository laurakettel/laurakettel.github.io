Under Review.\n\n\nPeer-reviewed Publications\n\nReassessing the Impact of Local Control: When Smaller Local Governments Permit More Housing\nPerspectives on Politics (2025)\nDOI: 10.1017/S1537592725000799\n\n\nAbstract\n\nHousing scarcity is a widespread social and economic problem. Prior studies have attributed this scarcity to local control over land use, which has been seen as making policy makers more responsive to small electorates. Challenging this argument, we suggest that smaller jurisdictions have stronger incentives and greater capacity to raise tax revenue by building housing. Therefore, expanding the electorate that policy makers are responsive to could lead to a more restrictive housing policy. To explore this question empirically, we study a reform that consolidated some Danish municipalities, increasing the size of their jurisdiction. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that consolidated municipalities issue fewer permits and complete less housing than smaller jurisdictions. Our study thus shows that politicians permitted more housing when they were accountable to a smaller electorate. This upends conventional wisdom and suggests that local control need not be at odds with more liberal land use policy.\n\nA Tale of Two Crises: Urban Homelessness Policy during Covid-19\nUrban Affairs Review (2024). \nDOI: 10780874241279762.\n\n\nAbstract\n\nAt the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the situation of people experiencing homelessness, and what communities could do to protect this vulnerable subpopulation, emerged as an area of particular concern. People experiencing homelessness are both less likely to be able to self-isolate and more likely to suffer a severe case of Covid-19. To date, however, research on local targeted responses remains limited. This study fills a critical gap by providing the most extensive dataset to date on policy responses targeting homelessness during the pandemic. I analyze local policy responses across 254 U.S. communities, offering insights into the diversity and prevalence of measures implemented. The analysis suggests that variation in local responses is shaped by contextual factors, highlighting how the localized governance of homelessness exacerbates spatial inequalities in the absence of federal guidance.\n\n\n\n\nWorking papers\n\nEnergy Burden and Satisfaction with Democracy: The Political Consequences of Market Risk in Germany (with J.
